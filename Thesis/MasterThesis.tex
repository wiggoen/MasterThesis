Experiment conducted 8th - 14th of August 2017.

\textcolor{red}{Tilbakemelding:} \newline
\textcolor{red}{old REX-ISOLDE post-accelerator limited to 2.8 MeV/u (low Coulomb excitation cross section, low probability for multi-step excitation). Mo target was chosen to maximize cross section at this energy, and to normalize B(E2; $0^+ \rightarrow 2^+$) value in \Sm ~to the well-known B(E2) value for the target.} \newline
\textcolor{red}{New HIE-ISOLDE: energies up to 10 MeV/u $\implies$ we can choose high-Z target (Pb) $\implies$ high Coulex cross section, especially for multi-step. Also: B(E2) for \Sm ~now known from previous experiment (and a lifetime measurement) $\implies$ no need for normalization: we can use the known B(E2; $0^+ \rightarrow 2^+$) to nomalize the transition probabilities for the higher-lying transitions. Chosen 4.7 MeV/u as the highest possible energy that is safe for Pb (distance of closest approach large enough to exclude nuclear interaction.)}

\textcolor{red}{Tilbakemelding:} \newline
\textcolor{red}{shape coexistence often found near closed shells. Example: neutron deficient Hg nuclei (Z = 80 just below 82 shell closure, N $\sim$ 104: neutron mid-shell). \newline
\Sm: N = 78, just below N = 82 shell closure, Z = 62: mid-shell. \newline
Typical indication for shape coexistence: $0^+$ states (often at low energy). \newline 
\Sm ~was thought to have a low-lying $0^+$ state [Firestone], but this state was shown to be $2^+$ [Suoranczyk?]. Indication for $0^+$ states around 1.5 MeV. \newline 
One of the objectives of this experiment: clarify the nature/structure of these $0^+$ states. \newline 
Shape transition: Sm-144 (Z = 62, N = 82) spherical. Adding neutrons: transition of N = 90 from spherical to prolate deformed $\rightarrow$ shape-phase transition, so called X(5) critical-point symmetry. \newline
Taking out neutrons: very neutron-deficient Sm nuclei are also prolate deformed (e.g. Sm-132), but for \Sm: indication for triaxiality/\ga-softness [Klintefjord] $\rightarrow$ another form of shape-phase transition/critical point behavior $\implies$ E(5) [Iachello?]. \Sm ~could be one of the best examples for E(5) symmetry $\implies$ need transition probabilities from higher-lying states to confirm.} \newline

\textcolor{red}{Oppgavens mål:} \newline
The ISOLDE facility at CERN has been upgraded to provide higher energies and intensities for radioactive ion beams. A new experiment to study 140Sm was performed in the summer of 2017. The goal of the experiment was to measure electromagnetic transition probabilities and electric quadrupole moments for several excited states in 140Sm by measuring Coulomb excitation probabilities. A large data set was obtained using silicon detectors to determine the energies and angles of scattered particles, and germanium detectors to measure gamma rays from excited states in 140Sm. \newline

The goal of the master thesis is to analyze the data from this experiment. The required tasks include development and improvement of data analysis software to determine Coulomb excitation yields. These yields will then, in a second step, be compared to theoretical calculations and transition probabilities and quadrupole moments will be extracted using chi-square minimization procedures. \newline


\textcolor{red}{Prosjektbeskrivelse (omfang 60 studiepoeng):} \newline
The shape of an atomic nucleus is determined by a delicate interplay between macroscopic (liquid drop) properties and microscopic shell effects. Nuclei with filled proton or neutron shells (i.e. magic nuclei) are generally spherical in shape, whereas nuclei with open shells gain energy by assuming a deformed shape. Depending on the occupation of specific orbitals, the nuclear shape can change drastically by adding or removing protons or neutrons. Certain nuclei exhibit shape coexistence, i.e. the coexistence of quantum states that correspond to different shapes. Because the shape of a nucleus is so sensitive to the underlying nuclear structure and to changes of the proton and neutron numbers, the excitation energy, or the angular momentum, observables related to the nuclear shape are used as benchmarks for theoretical models. 

Nuclei in the rare earth region, and in particular the chain of samarium isotopes, exhibit a variety of shape effects. The Sm isotope with closed neutron shell at N=82, 144Sm, is spherical in shape. Adding neutrons to 144Sm changes the deformation to an elongated (prolate) quadrupole shape. The transition from spherical to prolate shape, which occurs for 152Sm at N=90, can be interpreted as a shape-phase transition. Flattened (oblate) quadrupole shapes are predicted by theory to occur below the N=82 shell closure. An earlier experiment studying 140Sm at CERN-ISOLDE found triaxial shape for this isotope, i.e. a shape where all three principal axes of the ellipsoid have different lengths. 140Sm can therefore be considered to lie at the critical point of a phase transition from spherical to deformed, and from prolate to oblate shape. \newline

\section{ISOLDE at CERN}
The acronym ISOLDE stands for Isotope Separator On Line DEvice. ISOLDE is a Radioactive Ion Beam (RIB) facility at CERN in Meyrin, Switzerland.  \autoref{fig:accelerators} shows the CERN accelerator complex \cite{CERN-AC}, where ISOLDE is located beside the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB). The facility can produce over 1000 different radionuclides to be used in a wide variety of experiments in nuclear physics, atomic physics, solid state physics, life sciences and fundamental interactions. Experiments have been performed at ISOLDE since 1967 and since 2001 experiments with post-accelerated RIBs have been conducted. The high intensity and energy upgrade (HIE-ISOLDE) have made it possible to deliver energies up to 10 MeV/$u$ in 2018 \cite{HIE-ISOLDE, ISOLDE-web, ISOLDE-facility}. 

Most of the around 4000 known nuclides are radioactive. In many cases it is not possible to make radioactive nuclei targets and perform an experiment because of the short half-life of the nucleus of interest. To study these radioactive nuclei, RIBs are used on stable targets. One way of obtaining a RIB is to use the Isotope Separator On Line (ISOL) method. In the ISOL method, two accelerator systems is needed. The first accelerator is used to produce the radioactive atoms at rest, and the second accelerator is used to accelerate these atoms \cite{ISOL}.

	\caption{The CERN accelerator complex. ISOLDE gets accelerated protons from LINAC 2 and the PS BOOSTER.}
	\label{fig:accelerators}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Beam production}
A continuous flow of accelerated proton beam bunches from the PSB comes into the ISOLDE facility and collide with a thick production target. The proton beam has an energy of 1.4 GeV and an intensity up to 2 $\mu$A. Two proton beam bunches is separated by 1.2 s. ISOLDE typically takes 50\% \textcolor{red}{\textbf{REF?}} of all proton bunches form the PSB, the rest goes to the LHC and other experiments shown in \autoref{fig:accelerators}. In the reaction between the proton beam and the production target, radioactive nuclides are produced in spallation, fission or fragmentation reactions (basically smashing the target into pieces) \cite{ISOLDE-web}. The production target is chosen from a stable region heavier than the nucleus of interest. In our experiment, a production target of tantalum (Ta) was used, producing the elements in the chart of nuclides up to tantalum. A large amount of different isotopes is produced in this way, and the challenge is to extract the nucleus of interest.

\textcolor{red}{RILIS:} \newline
The resonance ionization laser ion source (RILIS) is based on the method of step-wise excitation and ionization of the atom. It is an element-selective process which is used to produce ion beams of the correct element \cite{RILIS}. In this experiment RILIS was used to select samarium with atomic number $Z = 62$.

\bigskip

\textcolor{red}{GPS:} \newline
The beam can collide in one of two target stations, either the general purpose separator (GPS) or the high resolution separator (HRS). The GPS has one bending magnet and can deliver beams of different masses simultaneously into three beam lines, while the HRS has two bending magnets with high mass resolving power which delivers the beam into the main beam line \cite{GPS}. In this experiment the GPS was used to select the isotope of samarium with mass number $A = 140$.

REXEBIS is a charge breeder where the RIB is bred to a high charge state \cite{REXEBIS}, with a mass-to-charge ($A/q$) ratio typically between 2.5 and 4.5 \cite{Post-acc}.

* Kan skrive om dette i motivasjonen

\Pb\ was chosen as a target. Want high $Z$ so that the probability of excitation is high. \newline

Doubly magic, very hard to excite. No quadrupole deformation/excitation. Need quadrupole for first state (see nndc)

ja og nei: Not enough beam energy to excite \Pb. \newline

Highest $Z$ for maximum excitation probability.

\section{Data and sorting}
The analysis code for Miniball data is named MiniballCoulexSort and is available on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/Miniball/MiniballCoulexSort}. 
The main steps of how to download, install and use it is outlined in the README.md file in the GitHub repository. 

Data from Miniball comes in the form of .med-files (Miniball Event Data). 
In order to analyze this data in ROOT\footnote{ROOT is a data analysis framework made at CERN.} the first part of the sorting is just to convert the .med-files into .root-files with the script MedToRoot. 

To get useful information out of the converted .root-files, the Treebuilder script is used. 
The .root-file(s) and a calibration file is given to the Treebuilder so it can make event trees that can be used for analyzing the Coulomb excitation events. 

One script that is mentioned in the Miniball GitHub repository, but not showed how to use, is the AQ4Sort. It is used in the same way as the TreeBuilder script, but it sorts the histograms in another way. 
This script is used before and during the calibration of the detectors, because it gives information about every single ring and every single back strip. The one thing to note here, is that the numbering of the detector rings and strips are different from the ones used in Treebuilder. 


The histograms sorted by Treebuilder starts counting from 0 and the AQ4Sort starts counting from 1. 

The ADC spectras from the file sorted by Treebuilder have a naming convention of adc\_q\_s, where $q$ corresponds to the quadrant and $s$ corresponds to the channel. The front energy is saved in adc\_[0-3]\_[0-15] and the back energy from strips 1-12 from all 16 rings (the whole quadrant) is saved in adc\_[0-3]\_[16-27].

adc\_0\_0 in the file sorted by Treebuilder is the same as fE\_Q1\_f1 sorted by AQ4Sort. All the front detectors can be found in the Treebuilder-sorted file, but when it comes to the back detector, the single pixels from the strips are not shown. These are available through the AQ4Sort sorted file. For the front detectors the histograms adc\_[0-3]\_[0-15] and fE\_Q[1-4]\_f[1-16] are the same. For the back detectors, we have that adc\_[0-3]\_[16-27] and bE\_Q[1-4]\_b[1-12] are the same. In addition in AQ4Sort we can see the different pixels. The histograms fE\_Q[1-4]\_f[1-16]\_b[1-12] shows the front energy of quadrant 1-4 gated on ring 1-16 and back strip 1-12, while the bE\_Q[1-4]\_f[1-16]\_b[1-12] shows the same, only for the back energy. 

In the naming convention of adc\_q\_s or fE\_Qu\_fv, where $q \in [0, 1, 2, 3], s \in [0, 1, \ldots, 27]$ and $u \in [1, 2, 3, 4], v \in [1, 2, \ldots, 16]$, the $s = 0$ and $v = 1$ is the outermost ring, while $s = 15$ and $v = 16$ is the innermost ring. In our case, the innermost ring was so destroyed that we have to remove it from the data analysis.


adc\_q\_s, where $q \in [0, 1, 2, 3], s \in [0, 1, \ldots, 27]$.

$p$E\_Q$q$\_f$r$\_b$s$, where $ \in [b, f], q \in [1, 2, 3, 4], r \in [1, 2, \ldots, 16]$ and $s \in [1, 2, \ldots, 12]$. 

The adc\_[0-3]\_[16-27] or bE\_Q[1-4]\_b[1-12] are a combination of all the 16 rings of bE\_Q[1-4]f\_[1, 2, $\ldots$, 16]\_b[1-12].

Don't blame me for the naming convention, I did not write the code. I just tried to make sense of it.

\section{Helping scripts}
All of my scripts are available in the GitHub repository \url{https://github.com/wiggoen/MasterThesis}.

In order to not copy and paste the sorting command in the terminal for every data file, I made two bash scripts to do this. The script \textbf{M2R.sh} is using MedToRoot to take in as many files as you want, and sort it in one go. The other script is \textbf{AQ4S.sh}, which is using either AQ4Sort or Treebuilder to sort a lot of files in one go. 

I also made other helping scripts to get histograms, do fitting, comparison and calibration. 

My scripts: MultiFit.cpp, MultiPlot.cpp, ++ (python, bash,..)


\section{Simulation}
To calibrate the data, we need to know the expected energy of the centroids of the peaks. 
This was done by simulating the experiment in a program called kinsim3. The program is written by Liam Gaffney\footnote{Liam Gaffney is a fellow at ISOLDE, affiliated with MINIBALL.} and the purpose of the program is to simulate the kinematics of the experiment. 
It takes into account the Silicon dead layer. 

kinsim3 generates pdf-files of the stopping powers automatically. 
The rest of the plots are available inside the root-file. 
To get the energy simulation for each ring, the function \textbf{cd\_sim\_plots()} from the script \textbf{MultiPlot.cpp} was used.

"the source has a thickness of 1.23 mm, which needs to be factored in so that the CD to target distance is the CD to source distance PLUS the source thickness, i.e. 25.78 mm + 1.23 mm =  27.01 mm. 
This is very close to the 26.98 mm you got from us in August.

\section{Calibration}

My goal of the calibration was to make a program that could automatically fit the plots i needed, but it became more and more manual labor. 
Because of the shape of the data peaks, it demands very much individual care. 
This I could not do with a automatic program. 
The downfall of the automatic centroid collector came when trying it on the back detectors. 

The total amount particle front detectors to calibrate is 4 quadrants * 16 rings = 64 front detectors 

back detectors: 4 quadrants * 12 strips = 48 back detectors


but to do this, one need all the centroids of the peaks from both sides:

front: 64 detectors * 2 peaks/ring = 128 centroids

back: 48 detectors * 2 peaks/ring * 16 rings =  1536 centroids 

total centroids to collect: 1664 centroids (this I did not want to do manually)

Full calibration with 16 rings and 12 back strips. We had to remove the innermost ring. 



\textcolor{red}{MOVE THE BELOW TO APPENDIX?}

For each file converted with MedToRoot, the program makes four files; OffBeam, OnBeam, OnBeamBackground and Scaler. The file we are interested in for analysis is the OnBeam file. 

First all of the interesting files are converted with the M2R.sh script. 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
$ cd /Users/trondwj/GitHub/MasterThesis/Scripts/sorting 
$ ./M2R.sh Sm
\end{lstlisting}

Then the OnBeam files from M2R.sh is run through using Treebuilder in the AQ4S.sh script. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
$ cd /Users/trondwj/GitHub/MasterThesis/Scripts/sorting 
$ ./AQ4S.sh Sm user TB
$ mv Sm_user-TreeBuilder-2019-04-10.root ../../Sorted_data/
\end{lstlisting}


After the sorting, I moved the file to a folder of sorted data, and gave the relative path in the setup\_Sm.txt file in Scripts/plotting/ used as input in the MultiPlot.cpp script. 
Using the MultiPlot.cpp script, the ADC time offsets can be extracted by the following commands
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
$ cd /Users/trondwj/GitHub/MasterThesis/Scripts/plotting
$ root
root [0] .L MultiPlot.cpp++
root [1] check_ADC_time_offsets("setup_Sm.txt")
\end{lstlisting}
or they can be manually reached by
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
$ cd /Users/trondwj/GitHub/MasterThesis/Sorted_data
$ root Sm_user-TreeBuilder-2019-04-10.root
root [1] new TBrowser()
\end{lstlisting}
and in the browser, the histograms named tdiff\_gp\_\textit{i} (where \textit{i} is a number between 0 and 3) will lie under all the folders. The peaks of these plots have the interesting x-value. Zooming into the peaks, it is very clear what value it is. These values are provided in the calibration file under ADC time offsets (ticks). These values can change depending on the amount of data sorted, so it is wise to double check them.

After the peak values have been collected, they should be written into the calibration file
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
# ADC time offsets (ticks)
adc_0.TimeOffset:  0
adc_1.TimeOffset:  -2
adc_2.TimeOffset:  -3
adc_3.TimeOffset:  5
\end{lstlisting}

Skriv om scriptene som er lagd, og at det var litt vanskelig å automatisere kalibreringen. Hvis det skulle vært gjort måtte vi funnet en funksjon med "negatively skewed distribution" or "negative skewness" (right modal), en "left skewed function" (most data is more than the mean). 


I log-skala ser dette mer Gaussisk ut, men det er ikke det i non-log skala. 


Back detector calibration: There are just too much individual differences to calibrate the back detectors with a simple script given a range for all 12 back strips. I found out this way to late. There isn't any range to rule them all, at least since the fitting function can behave very strange given a too small or too big range.



\textbf{--- \textcolor{red}{Mail from Liam begins} ---}

"You might have to investigate the threshold a little bit. The continuum of events at low energy comes from charge sharing between the strips. For these very heavy ions, the total amount of charge deposited gets split between neighbouring strips of the CD. The code does performs some tricks to try and recover the correct energy and position, but that depends on counting the number of strips that fire. Therefore, if the threshold is too low you will include "pedestal" events and it will get things wrong. If the threshold is too high, you will miss some events that have charge sharing and get the wrong energy for your particle. 

The key spectra to look at are "part" and "cd\_debug". The latter counts how many particles have X strips fired on the front side and Y strips fired on the back side.

If you have too many cd\_debug events = 3, then your thresholds are too low. If you have a large continuum/background in the "part" spectrum, your thresholds are too high. Best thing to do is play about with different values.

Bin 20 is when no particle can be found, because there is no energy registered in either the front or the back strips. This can only happen when the front energy is below the software threshold that you set and the back energy is either in a broken strip or is also below the software threshold. Likely it is some noise events or charge sharing that comes below the threshold.

\textcolor{red}{The major problem with the online calibration is that a number of the back strips have the wrong gains}, but it otherwise looks quite good. Have you identified which strips these are, by comparing the gains between the 'online' and 'user' calibrations? You could maybe correct those strips as an intermediate step and see how things look.

the source has a thickness of 1.23 mm, which needs to be factored in so that the CD to target \textcolor{red}{distance is the CD} to source distance PLUS the source thickness, i.e. 25.78 mm + 1.23 mm =  27.01 mm. This is very close to the 26.98 mm you got from us in August. I think that the source data was reanalyzed since the original blog entry, giving the 0.03 mm difference!"

\textbf{--- \textcolor{red}{Mail from Liam ended} ---}



\textbf{Pedestal}

The pedestal is like a massive statue in front of the interesting data. 


We use a threshold to cut away the pedestal.

\end{figure}



\textbf{Threshold}

* Threshold (forskjellig i log/ikke-log skala)

Using a logarithmic y-axis, the threshold value will decrease very much. So don't use that. 

Threshold: The code has a default threshold of 100, but in some cases this is too much and some cases this is not enough. So for each adc channel, the threshold can be set. We don't want to include the "pedestal". Charge sharing.
Won't cut too much or too little..

To connect MiniballCoulexSort with ROOT you need them to share their libraries with each other. This is done with a dynamic loader. You can find out more here: \url{https://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html#file-system.rootrc}. 

You have to make a \textbf{.rootrc} file in your home folder on your computer. In the \textbf{.rootrc} file you want to write something like this 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
Unix.*.Root.DynamicPath:    .:</Users/trondwj/GitHub/ROOT-framework/build/lib>:/Users/trondwj/GitHub/Miniball/MiniballCoulexSort/lib:
\end{lstlisting}
This should all be in one line. The first part is to tell the system to use the dynamic loader of ROOT to connect the given paths that follow. In my case the lib folder of the ROOT install was at 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
/Users/trondwj/GitHub/ROOT-framework/build/lib
\end{lstlisting}
and the lib folder of the MiniballCoulexSort was at
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
/Users/trondwj/GitHub/Miniball/MiniballCoulexSort/lib
\end{lstlisting}
These paths is totally individual, and you will probably not have it in the same place. Therefore these paths must be changed to fit your system. 

After making the file you either have restart the terminal or you can source the file by writing this in the terminal
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
$ source ~/.rootrc
\end{lstlisting}


\chapter{Running ROOT and MiniballCoulexSort from anywhere in the terminal}
To run ROOT or the different scripts of MiniballCoulexSort anywhere in the terminal, you have to edit your \textbf{.bash\_profile} file [.bash\_profile on MacOS, .bashrc on Linux]. In my \textbf{.bash\_profile} I used this 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
# Run ROOT from anywhere
export ROOTSYS=$HOME/GitHub/ROOT-framework/build
export PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PATH
export PATH=$ROOTSYS/bin:$PATH
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

# Run MiniballCoulexSort from anywhere
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/GitHub/Miniball/MiniballCoulexSort/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=$HOME/GitHub/Miniball/MiniballCoulexSort/lib:$PATH
export PATH=$HOME/GitHub/Miniball/MiniballCoulexSort/bin:$PATH
\end{lstlisting}
The DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH is used on Mac only. On other systems, use \newline LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH. You need to locate the lib and bin folders for both ROOT and MiniballCoulexSort and change them to fit your system, and in addition you need the build folder of your ROOT install.

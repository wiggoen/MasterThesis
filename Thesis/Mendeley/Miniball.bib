abstract = {In 2001 the linear accelerator of the Radioactive beam EXperiment (REX-ISOLDE) delivered for the first time accelerated radioactive ion beams, at a beam energy of 2 MeV/u. REX-ISOLDE uses the method of charge-state breeding, in order to enhance the charge state of the ions before injection into the LINAC. Radioactive singly-charged ions from the on-line mass separator ISOLDE are first accumulated in a Penning trap, then charge bred to an A/q{\textless}4.5 in an electron beam ion source (EBIS) and finally accelerated in a LINAC from 5 keV/u to energies between 0.8 and 2.2 MeV/u. Dedicated measurements with REXTRAP, the transfer line and the EBIS have been carried out in conjunction with the first commissioning of the accelerator. Thus the properties of the different elements could be determined for further optimization of the system. In two test beam times in 2001 stable and radioactive Na isotopes (23Na-26Na) have been accelerated and transmitted to a preliminary target station. There 58Ni- and 9Be- and 2H-targets have been used to study exited states via Coulomb excitation and neutron transfer reactions. One MINIBALL triple cluster detector was used together with a double sided silicon strip detector to detect scattered particles in coincidence with $\gamma$-rays. The aim was to study the operation of the detector under realistic conditions with $\gamma$-background from the $\beta$-decay of the radioactive ions and from the cavities. Recently for efficient detection eight tripple Ge-detectors of MINIBALL and a double sided silicon strip detector have been installed. We will present the first results obtained in the commissioning experiments and will give an overview of realistic beam parameters for future experiments to be started in the spring 2002. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The Miniball germanium detector array has been operational at the REX (Radioactive ion beam EXperiment) post accelerator at the Isotope Separator On-Line facility ISOLDE at CERN since 2001. During the last decade, a series of successful Coulomb excitation and transfer reaction studies have been performed with this array, utilizing the unique and high-quality radioactive ion beams which are available at ISOLDE. In this article, an overview is given of the technical details of the full Miniball setup, including a description of the $\gamma$-ray and particle detectors, beam monitoring devices and methods to deal with beam contamination. The specific timing properties of the REX-ISOLDE facility are highlighted to indicate the sensitivity that can be achieved with the full Miniball setup. The article is finalized with a summary of some physics highlights at REX-ISOLDE and the utilization of the Miniball germanium detectors at other facilities.},

@article{Lindroos2004,
abstract = {The ISOL technique was invented in Copenhagen over 50 years ago and eventually migrated to CERN where a suitable proton drive beam was available at the Syncho-Cyclotron. The quick spread of the technique to many other laboratories has resulted in a large user commu-nity, which has assured the continued development of the method, physics in the front-line of fundamental research and the application of the method to many applied sci-ences. The technique is today established as one of the main techniques for on-line isotope production of high in-tensity and high quality beams. The thick targets used al-low the production of unmatched high intensity radioactive beams. The fact that the ions are produced at rest makes it ideally suitable for low energy experiments and for post acceleration using well established accelerator techniques. The many different versions of the technique will be dis-cussed and the many facilities spread all over the world will be reviewed. The major developments at the existing facilities and the challenges encountered will be presented. Finally, the possibility of using the resulting high intensity beams for the production of intense neutrino beams will be briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Cooling of radioactive ion beams in a Penning trap is an essential component of the post-accelerator REX-ISOLDE at CERN. Prior to their charge-breeding and acceleration, ions from the on-line mass separator ISOLDE are accumulated, cooled and bunched with REXTRAP. This beam preparation provides short ion pulses with low emittance, key ingredient for a high efficiency of REX-ISOLDE. Two different cooling techniques have been investigated with REXTRAP. Both rely on the use of a buffer gas as the coolant but differ in the way the transversal compression of the stored ion cloud is achieved. Sideband cooling with a light buffer gas as coolant is the standard technique used at REXTRAP so far. With this technique an efficiency of about 45{\%} for the injection, cooling, and extraction process has been obtained for stable and radioactive ions. For about 105 simultaneously stored ions the resulting emittance of the extracted ion pulses is about 10$\pi$mm mrad at 30 keV beam energy. For much larger numbers of ions shifts of the resonance frequency of the sideband excitation are observed together with an emittance growth. As an alternative to sideband cooling a "rotating wall" technique was tested. First results with rotating dipole as well as quadrupole fields are presented. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A charge state breeder, which transforms externally injected singly charged ions to a higher charge state q+, is an important tool which has applications within atomic, nuclear and even particle physics. The charge breeding concept of radioactive ions has already been demonstrated at REX-ISOLDE/CERN with the use of an Electron beam Ion Source (EBIS) and at several facilities employing Electron Resonance Cyclotron Ion Sources (ECRIS). As will be demonstrated in this paper, EBIS and Electron Beam Ion Traps (EBIT), are well suited for the task as they are capable of delivering clean, highly charged beams within a short transformation time. The increasing demand for highly charged ions of all kind of elements and isotopes, stable and radioactive, to be used for low-energy experiments such as TITAN at TRIUMF and MATS at FAIR, but also for post-acceleration to higher energies, is now pushing the development of the breeders. The next challenge will be to satisfy the needs, for example space-charge capacity, of the second generation radioactive beam facilities presently under construction or in the design stage, such as the MSU re-accelerator (ReA3), SPIRAL2, SPES and later on EURISOL. Radioactive trap facilities will also require high performance breeders geared towards rapid breeding times. The requirements and the critical issues of the breeding concept will be discussed and a review of the different facilities, operational and planned, will be given. The paper does furthermore feature a summary of the extensive breeding experience gained under operational conditions at REX-ISOLDE, including results from dedicated beam cleaning tests, isotope production using in-trap decay, high-current and continuous ion injection into the breeder, and closed-shell breeding.},

This accelerator provides an average current of about 2 $\mu$A of 1 GeV protons in very short high intensity pulses at low repetition rate.

The ISOLDE facility at CERN has as objective the production, study and research of nuclei far from stability. The facility provides low energy radioactive beams and post-accelerated beams. In the last 45 years the ISOLDE facility has gathered unique expertise in research with radioactive beams. Over 700 isotopes of more than 70 elements have been used in a wide range of research domains, including cutting edge studies in nuclear structure, atomic physics, nuclear astrophysics, and fundamental interactions. These nuclear probes are also used to do frontier research in solid state and life sciences. There is an on-going upgrade of the facility, the HIE-ISOLDE project, which aims to improve the ISOLDE capabilities in a wide front, from an energy increase of the post-accelerated beam to improvements in beam quality and beam purity. The first phase of HIE-ISOLDE will start for physics in the autumn of 2015 with an upgrade of energy for all post-accelerated ISOLDE beams up to 5.5 MeV/u, the second phase will increase the energy until 10 MeV/u. Plans exist of complementing the facility with a highly performing Storage Ring, TSR presently at Heidelberg in Germany. The addition of the TSR will allow the beams from HIE-ISOLDE to be stored and cooled, providing much greater luminosity and much better beam definition. In this contribution the most recent highlights of the facility and an overview of the approved day-one experiments for HIE-ISOLDE phase I are presented.},

abstract = {The numerous forthcoming post-accelerators for radioactive ions produced with the isotope separator on-line (ISOL) technique all have a need for an efficient method to accelerate the precious primary ions. By including an Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) as a charge breeder after the radioactive ion production stage, a short and compact linear accelerator can be employed as a result of the increased ion charge-to-mass ratio. In view of the constraints on a post-accelerator for radioactive beams, an EBIS appears to be an attractive solution. It is independent of the element injected and an overall efficiency as high as 30{\%} for the peak charge can be attained. The mean charge state of the extracted ion beam is easily varied by changing the breeding time and the beam has excellent properties (time structure and emittance) for LINAC injection. Furthermore, the extraction of a bunched beam improves the signal-to-noise ratio for low-intensity beams and the UHV inside the source permits the mass separation of very weak radioactive beams from the residual gas contamination. With a high electron-beam density, the breeding time can be kept short, so decay losses are minimized. To obtain a high efficiency for a charge breeding EBIS, it is advantageous if the beam from the ISOL system is bunched and has its emittance reduced before injection. To achieve this a Penning trap can be introduced in front of the EBIS. The space-charge limit of the Penning trap restricts the number of ions per bunch to a couple of orders to magnitude lower than the constraint set by the EBIS. A positive side effect though, is that a mass selection can take place inside the trap. In this article the above listed features will be discussed. As an example, the charge breeding system for the REX-ISOLDE post-accelerator will be introduced. In addition, future possible developments of an EBIS leading to shorter breeding times, the acceptance of a continuous beam, and an increased number of charge bred ions will be discussed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Physical Society. {\textcopyright}2015 American Physical Society. au. Background: The chain of Sm isotopes exhibits a wide range of nuclear shapes and collective behavior. While the onset of deformation for N{\textgreater}82 has been well studied both experimentally and theoretically, fundamental data is lacking for some Sm isotopes with N{\textless}82. Purpose: Electromagnetic transition rates represent a sensitive test of theoretical nuclear structure models. Lifetime measurements are furthermore complementary to Coulomb excitation experiments, and the two methods together can give access to spectroscopic quadrupole moments. Method: The lifetime of the 21+ state in Sm140 was measured with the recoil-distance Doppler shift technique using the reaction Te124(Ne20,4n)Sm140 at 82 MeV. Theoretical calculations were performed based on a mapped collective Hamiltonian in five quadrupole coordinates (5DCH) and the Gogny D1S interaction. Results: The lifetime of the 21+ state in Sm140 was found to be 9.1(6) ps, corresponding to a B(E2;21+→01+) value of 51(4) Weisskopf units. The theoretical calculations are in very good agreement with the experimental result. Conclusions: The B(E2;21+→01+) value for Sm140 fits smoothly into the systematic trend for the chain of Sm isotopes. The new beyond-mean field calculations are able to correctly describe the onset of collectivity in the Sm isotopes below the N=82 shell closure for the first time.},

abstract = {The resonance ionization laser ion source (RILIS) produces beams for the majority of experiments at the ISOLDE on-line isotope separator. A substantial improvement in RILIS performance has been achieved through a series of upgrade steps: replacement of the copper vapor lasers by a Nd:YAG laser; replacement of the old homemade dye lasers by new commercial dye lasers; installation of a complementary Ti:Sapphire laser system. The combined dye and Ti:Sapphire laser system with harmonics is capable of generating beams at any wavelength in the range of 210-950 nm. In total, isotopes of 31 different elements have been selectively laser-ionized and separated at ISOLDE, including recently developed beams of samarium, praseodymium, polonium, and astatine.},

@article{RILIS2013,
abstract = {At the CERN ISOLDE facility, long isotope chains of many elements are produced by proton-induced reactions in target materials such as uranium carbide. The Resonance Ionization Laser Ion Source (RILIS) is an efficient and selective means of ionizing the reaction products to produce an ion beam of a chosen isotope. Coupling the RILIS with modern ion detection techniques enables highly sensitive studies of nuclear properties (spins, electromagnetic moments and charge radii) along an isotope chain, provided that the isotope shifts and hyperfine structure splitting of the atomic transitions can be resolved. At ISOLDE the campaign to measure the systematics of isotopes in the lead region (Pb, Bi, Tl and Po) has been extended to include the gold and astatine isotope chains. Several developments were specifically required for the feasibility of the most recent measurements: new ionization schemes (Po, At); a remote controlled narrow line-width mode of operation for the RILIS Ti:sapphire laser (At, Au, Po); isobar free ionization using the Laser Ion Source Trap, LIST (Po); isobar selective particle identification using the multi-reflection time-of-flight mass separator (MR-ToF MS) of ISOLTRAP (Au, At). These are summarized as part of an overview of the current status of the in-source resonance ionization spectroscopy setup at ISOLDE. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{REXEBIS,
abstract = {REXEBIS is the charge breeder of the REX-ISOLDE postaccelerator. Radioactive 1+ ions produced at ISOLDE are accumulated, phase-space cooled and bunched in REXTRAP, and thereafter injected into the EBIS with an energy of up to 60 keV. The REXEBIS produced the first charge bred ions in August 2001 and has been running nearly non-stop from September to December 2001. It has delivered stable 39K10+ and 23Na7+ beams generated in the test ion-source in front of REXTRAP with a current of 12 pA for K10+ and a Na7+ current exceeding 70 pA (6 × 107 p/s). Stable 27Al7+ and 23Na6+ (about 10 pA) and also the first radioactive 26Na7+ and 24Na7+ beams (just 0.4 pA or 5 × 105 p/s), from the ISOLDE separator have been charge bred and accelerated for tests of the experimental setup. Despite some problems with the LaB6 cathode (one total breakdown after about 1500 h of operation), displaying slow changes of the emission conditions, the EBIS is working remarkably stable. We report about the first ion injections, ion source details, cathode conditions as well as other commissioning results. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{MB-spect,
abstract = {The Miniball germanium detector array has been operational at the REX (Radioactive ion beam EXperiment) post accelerator at the Isotope Separator On-Line facility ISOLDE at CERN since 2001. During the last decade, a series of successful Coulomb excitation and transfer reaction studies have been performed with this array, utilizing the unique and high-quality radioactive ion beams which are available at ISOLDE. In this article, an overview is given of the technical details of the full Miniball setup, including a description of the $\gamma$-ray and particle detectors, beam monitoring devices and methods to deal with beam contamination. The specific timing properties of the REX-ISOLDE facility are highlighted to indicate the sensitivity that can be achieved with the full Miniball setup. The article is finalized with a summary of some physics highlights at REX-ISOLDE and the utilization of the Miniball germanium detectors at other facilities.},

The overall aim of the HIE-ISOLDE project is to enlarge the physics domains achievable with these beams, in particular by raising the maximum energy of post-accelerated beams to more than 10MeV/u. An outline of the history of the project is followed by a succinct description of the superconducting linac chosen for acceleration and an overview of the parts of the project aiming to the improvement of the beam quality and intensity. Concrete examples are given of experiments that will be performed at HIE-ISOLDE.},

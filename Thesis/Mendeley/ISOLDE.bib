abstract = {The resonance ionization laser ion source (RILIS) produces beams for the majority of experiments at the ISOLDE on-line isotope separator. A substantial improvement in RILIS performance has been achieved through a series of upgrade steps: replacement of the copper vapor lasers by a Nd:YAG laser; replacement of the old homemade dye lasers by new commercial dye lasers; installation of a complementary Ti:Sapphire laser system. The combined dye and Ti:Sapphire laser system with harmonics is capable of generating beams at any wavelength in the range of 210-950 nm. In total, isotopes of 31 different elements have been selectively laser-ionized and separated at ISOLDE, including recently developed beams of samarium, praseodymium, polonium, and astatine.},

abstract = {The ISOLDE on-line isotope separators have been operated since 1967 at the CERN-SC. This 600 MeV proton synchro-cyclotron had to be shut down in December 1990 after 33 years of service and it was decided to move ISOLDE to a new experimental area. The new on-line mass-separator facility is now under construction at the CERN PS-Booster. This accelerator provides an average current of about 2 $\mu$A of 1 GeV protons in very short high intensity pulses at low repetition rate. The beam can hit either one of the two target stations, the general purpose separator (GPS), a reconstructed ISOLDE-2 type machine (which can deliver beams simultaneously into three beam lines), and the high resolution separator (HRS), which is essentially the slightly modified ISOLDE-3 separator. The central GPS beam line and the HRS feed a common beam transport system to which most of the experiments will be connected. The new facility will be taken into operation in spring 1992. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {The Miniball germanium detector array has been operational at the REX (Radioactive ion beam EXperiment) post accelerator at the Isotope Separator On-Line facility ISOLDE at CERN since 2001. During the last decade, a series of successful Coulomb excitation and transfer reaction studies have been performed with this array, utilizing the unique and high-quality radioactive ion beams which are available at ISOLDE. In this article, an overview is given of the technical details of the full Miniball setup, including a description of the $\gamma$-ray and particle detectors, beam monitoring devices and methods to deal with beam contamination. The specific timing properties of the REX-ISOLDE facility are highlighted to indicate the sensitivity that can be achieved with the full Miniball setup. The article is finalized with a summary of some physics highlights at REX-ISOLDE and the utilization of the Miniball germanium detectors at other facilities.},

@article{REXEBIS,
abstract = {REXEBIS is the charge breeder of the REX-ISOLDE postaccelerator. Radioactive 1+ ions produced at ISOLDE are accumulated, phase-space cooled and bunched in REXTRAP, and thereafter injected into the EBIS with an energy of up to 60 keV. The REXEBIS produced the first charge bred ions in August 2001 and has been running nearly non-stop from September to December 2001. It has delivered stable 39K10+ and 23Na7+ beams generated in the test ion-source in front of REXTRAP with a current of 12 pA for K10+ and a Na7+ current exceeding 70 pA (6 × 107 p/s). Stable 27Al7+ and 23Na6+ (about 10 pA) and also the first radioactive 26Na7+ and 24Na7+ beams (just 0.4 pA or 5 × 105 p/s), from the ISOLDE separator have been charge bred and accelerated for tests of the experimental setup. Despite some problems with the LaB6 cathode (one total breakdown after about 1500 h of operation), displaying slow changes of the emission conditions, the EBIS is working remarkably stable. We report about the first ion injections, ion source details, cathode conditions as well as other commissioning results. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A detailed study of alpha interactions on the passivation layer on the end-plate of a true-coaxial high-purity germanium detector is presented. The observation of alpha events on such a surface indicates an unexpectedly thin so-called “effective dead layer” of less than 20 µm thickness. In addition, the influence of the metalisation close to the end-plate on the time evolution of the output pulses is discussed. The results indicate that alpha contamination can result in events which could be mistaken as signals for neutrinoless double beta decay and provide some guidance on how to prevent this.},

@article{Wilkins1971,
abstract = {The pulse-height vs energy response of a surface-barrier detector was measured for the ions He, C, O, Al, S, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au and U. The detector was a “heavy-ion” type, with high field strength. The ions were obtained by elastically scattering oxygen and sulfur beams on the appropriate targets. The lighter ions (up to sulfur) showed little or no pulse-height defect (PHD). Heavier ions had a significant PHD which increased with increasing energy, and their response curves were non-linear at low energies. The highest energies at which the PHD was measured were: Ni, 58 MeV; Cu, 18 MeV; Ag, 45 MeV; Au, 31 MeV; and U, 26 MeV. The total PHD is described in terms of three contributing parts: a window defect, a nuclear-stopping defect, and a residual defect, which is attributed to charge recombination. The residual defect is shown to be proportional to the difference between the electronic stopping power of the ion in silicon and a constant, in agreement with a simple model of the recombination defect. The constant is the critical value of the stopping power, below which no recombination occurs. Although there is insufficient data on which to base a practical scheme for calibrating detectors for heavy ions at the present time, some features which appear necessary to such a scheme are pointed out.},

In the last 3 decades new reaction theories for Coulomb excitation have been developed such as: (a) relativistic Coulomb excitation, (b) Coulomb excitation at intermediate energies, and (c) multistep coupling in the continuum. These developments are timely with the advent of rare isotope facilities. Of special interest is the Coulomb excitation and dissociation of weakly-bound systems. I review the Coulomb excitation theory, from low to relativistic collision energies. Several applications of the theory to situations of interest in nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics are discussed.},

@article{EBIS2010,
abstract = {A charge state breeder, which transforms externally injected singly charged ions to a higher charge state q+, is an important tool which has applications within atomic, nuclear and even particle physics. The charge breeding concept of radioactive ions has already been demonstrated at REX-ISOLDE/CERN with the use of an Electron beam Ion Source (EBIS) and at several facilities employing Electron Resonance Cyclotron Ion Sources (ECRIS). As will be demonstrated in this paper, EBIS and Electron Beam Ion Traps (EBIT), are well suited for the task as they are capable of delivering clean, highly charged beams within a short transformation time. The increasing demand for highly charged ions of all kind of elements and isotopes, stable and radioactive, to be used for low-energy experiments such as TITAN at TRIUMF and MATS at FAIR, but also for post-acceleration to higher energies, is now pushing the development of the breeders. The next challenge will be to satisfy the needs, for example space-charge capacity, of the second generation radioactive beam facilities presently under construction or in the design stage, such as the MSU re-accelerator (ReA3), SPIRAL2, SPES and later on EURISOL. Radioactive trap facilities will also require high performance breeders geared towards rapid breeding times. The requirements and the critical issues of the breeding concept will be discussed and a review of the different facilities, operational and planned, will be given. The paper does furthermore feature a summary of the extensive breeding experience gained under operational conditions at REX-ISOLDE, including results from dedicated beam cleaning tests, isotope production using in-trap decay, high-current and continuous ion injection into the breeder, and closed-shell breeding.},

abstract = {At the CERN ISOLDE facility, long isotope chains of many elements are produced by proton-induced reactions in target materials such as uranium carbide. The Resonance Ionization Laser Ion Source (RILIS) is an efficient and selective means of ionizing the reaction products to produce an ion beam of a chosen isotope. Coupling the RILIS with modern ion detection techniques enables highly sensitive studies of nuclear properties (spins, electromagnetic moments and charge radii) along an isotope chain, provided that the isotope shifts and hyperfine structure splitting of the atomic transitions can be resolved. At ISOLDE the campaign to measure the systematics of isotopes in the lead region (Pb, Bi, Tl and Po) has been extended to include the gold and astatine isotope chains. Several developments were specifically required for the feasibility of the most recent measurements: new ionization schemes (Po, At); a remote controlled narrow line-width mode of operation for the RILIS Ti:sapphire laser (At, Au, Po); isobar free ionization using the Laser Ion Source Trap, LIST (Po); isobar selective particle identification using the multi-reflection time-of-flight mass separator (MR-ToF MS) of ISOLTRAP (Au, At).

This 600 MeV proton synchro-cyclotron had to be shut down in December 1990 after 33 years of service and it was decided to move ISOLDE to a new experimental area. The new on-line mass-separator facility is now under construction at the CERN PS-Booster. This accelerator provides an average current of about 2 $\mu$A of 1 GeV protons in very short high intensity pulses at low repetition rate. The beam can hit either one of the two target stations, the general purpose separator (GPS), a reconstructed ISOLDE-2 type machine (which can deliver beams simultaneously into three beam lines), and the high resolution separator (HRS), which is essentially the slightly modified ISOLDE-3 separator. The central GPS beam line and the HRS feed a common beam transport system to which most of the experiments will be connected.

abstract = {Measurements on a 12-fold segmented, n-type, large volume, irregular shaped HPGe detector were performed in order to determine the parameters of anisotropic mobility for electrons and holes as charge carriers created by $\gamma$-ray interactions. To characterize the electron mobility the complete outer detector surface was scanned in small steps employing photopeak interactions at 60 keV. A precise measurement of the hole drift anisotropy was performed with 356 keV $\gamma$-rays. The drift velocity anisotropy and crystal geometry cause considerable rise time differences in pulse shapes depending on the position of the spatial charge carrier creation. Pulse shapes of direct and transient signals are reproduced by weighting potential calculations with high precision. The measured angular dependence of rise times is caused by the anisotropic mobility, crystal geometry, changing field strength and space charge effects. Preamplified signals were processed employing digital spectroscopy electronics. Response functions, crosstalk contributions and averaging procedures were taken into account implying novel methods due to the segmentation of the Ge-crystal and digital signal processing electronics. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Physical Society. {\textcopyright}2015 American Physical Society. au. Background: The chain of Sm isotopes exhibits a wide range of nuclear shapes and collective behavior. While the onset of deformation for N{\textgreater}82 has been well studied both experimentally and theoretically, fundamental data is lacking for some Sm isotopes with N{\textless}82. Purpose: Electromagnetic transition rates represent a sensitive test of theoretical nuclear structure models. Lifetime measurements are furthermore complementary to Coulomb excitation experiments, and the two methods together can give access to spectroscopic quadrupole moments. Method: The lifetime of the 21+ state in Sm140 was measured with the recoil-distance Doppler shift technique using the reaction Te124(Ne20,4n)Sm140 at 82 MeV. Theoretical calculations were performed based on a mapped collective Hamiltonian in five quadrupole coordinates (5DCH) and the Gogny D1S interaction. Results: The lifetime of the 21+ state in Sm140 was found to be 9.1(6) ps, corresponding to a B(E2;21+→01+) value of 51(4) Weisskopf units. The theoretical calculations are in very good agreement with the experimental result. Conclusions: The B(E2;21+→01+) value for Sm140 fits smoothly into the systematic trend for the chain of Sm isotopes. The new beyond-mean field calculations are able to correctly describe the onset of collectivity in the Sm isotopes below the N=82 shell closure for the first time.},

@article{EBIS2002,
abstract = {The numerous forthcoming post-accelerators for radioactive ions produced with the isotope separator on-line (ISOL) technique all have a need for an efficient method to accelerate the precious primary ions. By including an Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) as a charge breeder after the radioactive ion production stage, a short and compact linear accelerator can be employed as a result of the increased ion charge-to-mass ratio. In view of the constraints on a post-accelerator for radioactive beams, an EBIS appears to be an attractive solution. It is independent of the element injected and an overall efficiency as high as 30{\%} for the peak charge can be attained. The mean charge state of the extracted ion beam is easily varied by changing the breeding time and the beam has excellent properties (time structure and emittance) for LINAC injection. Furthermore, the extraction of a bunched beam improves the signal-to-noise ratio for low-intensity beams and the UHV inside the source permits the mass separation of very weak radioactive beams from the residual gas contamination. With a high electron-beam density, the breeding time can be kept short, so decay losses are minimized. To obtain a high efficiency for a charge breeding EBIS, it is advantageous if the beam from the ISOL system is bunched and has its emittance reduced before injection. To achieve this a Penning trap can be introduced in front of the EBIS. The space-charge limit of the Penning trap restricts the number of ions per bunch to a couple of orders to magnitude lower than the constraint set by the EBIS. A positive side effect though, is that a mass selection can take place inside the trap. In this article the above listed features will be discussed. As an example, the charge breeding system for the REX-ISOLDE post-accelerator will be introduced. In addition, future possible developments of an EBIS leading to shorter breeding times, the acceptance of a continuous beam, and an increased number of charge bred ions will be discussed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Cooling of radioactive ion beams in a Penning trap is an essential component of the post-accelerator REX-ISOLDE at CERN. Prior to their charge-breeding and acceleration, ions from the on-line mass separator ISOLDE are accumulated, cooled and bunched with REXTRAP. This beam preparation provides short ion pulses with low emittance, key ingredient for a high efficiency of REX-ISOLDE. Two different cooling techniques have been investigated with REXTRAP. Both rely on the use of a buffer gas as the coolant but differ in the way the transversal compression of the stored ion cloud is achieved. Sideband cooling with a light buffer gas as coolant is the standard technique used at REXTRAP so far. With this technique an efficiency of about 45{\%} for the injection, cooling, and extraction process has been obtained for stable and radioactive ions. For about 105 simultaneously stored ions the resulting emittance of the extracted ion pulses is about 10$\pi$mm mrad at 30 keV beam energy. For much larger numbers of ions shifts of the resonance frequency of the sideband excitation are observed together with an emittance growth. As an alternative to sideband cooling a "rotating wall" technique was tested. First results with rotating dipole as well as quadrupole fields are presented. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In the last 45 years the ISOLDE facility has gathered unique expertise in research with radioactive beams. Over 700 isotopes of more than 70 elements have been used in a wide range of research domains, including cutting edge studies in nuclear structure, atomic physics, nuclear astrophysics, and fundamental interactions. These nuclear probes are also used to do frontier research in solid state and life sciences. There is an on-going upgrade of the facility, the HIE-ISOLDE project, which aims to improve the ISOLDE capabilities in a wide front, from an energy increase of the post-accelerated beam to improvements in beam quality and beam purity. The first phase of HIE-ISOLDE will start for physics in the autumn of 2015 with an upgrade of energy for all post-accelerated ISOLDE beams up to 5.5 MeV/u, the second phase will increase the energy until 10 MeV/u. Plans exist of complementing the facility with a highly performing Storage Ring, TSR presently at Heidelberg in Germany. The addition of the TSR will allow the beams from HIE-ISOLDE to be stored and cooled, providing much greater luminosity and much better beam definition.

abstract = {Fast neutrons damage the lattice structure of germanium $\gamma$-radiation detectors and introduce hole traps. This results in a reduction of charge collection efficiency and a degradation of the energy resolution of the detector. For tracking detectors that use pulse shapes to determine the position of $\gamma$-ray interactions, it is important to study the effect of neutron damage on pulse shapes and to quantify the achievable position resolution. In this work, the effect of neutron damage on energy, position and time resolution has been calculated for both an n-type and a p-type detector, and a method for correcting the energy loss using the information on the position of the interaction has been tested. Calculations indicate that the energy resolution of a neutron-damaged n-type detector is superior to that of a similarly damaged p-type detector, while the position resolution does not depend on the detector type. For both n- and p-type coaxial detectors the detectable degradation of energy resolution occurs at a much lower neutron flux than the degradation of position resolution: in practice, a measurable effect of neutron damage on position resolution is never reached before annealing is required for recovering energy resolution. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This realization has sparked a new area of research, focusing on the concept of 'critical-point symmetries', which describe the structure of nuclei at phase-transitional points. Both macroscopic ( geometric or algebraic) and microscopic (shell-model) aspects of these phase transitions and of changes in structure with proton and neutron number in nuclei are discussed, along with an interpretation in terms of simple Landau theory. Finally, some alternative scenarios and schematic models for different classes of nuclei based on other simple potentials are briefly summarized.},

abstract = {From measurements of the Coulomb excitation of the 1.3325 MeV first excited state in 60Ni using sulphur and oxygen ions, it has been possible to obtain a value for the static quadrupole moment of this state. Analysis of the data using a coupled-channel computer code yields the results: B(E2; 0+ → 2+) = 0.0914±0.0020 (e {\textperiodcentered} b)2 and a first excited state static quadrupole moment of Q = 0.00±0.13 e {\textperiodcentered} b. These results are in good agreement with both microscopic- and macroscopic-model predictions. Uncertainty in the signs of the interference terms due to virtual excitation through higher excited 2+ states contributed 40{\%} of the error assigned to Q. The 16O scattering data deviated markedly from Coulomb excitation theory for incident energies above 30 MeV presumably due to the occurrence of nuclear interactions. These deviations were indistinguishable from those produced by the reorientation effect assuming a large negative static quadrupole moment for the first excited state.},

abstract = {Double Sided Silicon Strip Detectors (DSSSDs) are segmented silicon detectors widely used for the detection of charged particles. When a charged particle hits the gap between two adjacent strips, a signal, different from the full energy one, can be generated, resulting in an incorrect energy information. With the purpose of studying inter-strip effects on the detector response, an experiment was performed using a proton micro-beam. The response of two DSSSDs, 75 and 998$\mu$m thick, was measured as a function of the proton impact position, beam energy and bias voltage using a low intensity proton micro-beam of about few hundred particles per second (pps). Results show that the effective width of the inter-strip region, which in turn is related to the efficiency for full energy detection, varies with both detected energy and bias voltage. The experimental results are interpreted within a simplified model.},

The new model is based on the drifted Maxwellian hole distribution in Ge. It is verified by reproducing experimental longitudinal hole anisotropy data with high accuracy. A comparison between electron and hole mobility shows large differences for the longitudinal and tangential velocity anisotropy as a function of the electrical field orientation with respect to the crystal orientation. The anisotropic mobility causes measurable differences on rise times and pulse shapes which vary with the location where the charge carriers are created in the Ge crystal. These effects are relevant for position determination and $\gamma$-ray tracking. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
